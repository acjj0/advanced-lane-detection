# Advanced Lane-line Detection

NOTE: Before copying any part of this repository, confirm with github author acjj0


This is advanced lane line detection, with 
* Automatic camera calibration,  
* Distortion correction, 
* Color transforms and gradients to create threshold binaries with Sobel transformations,
* Sliding window search,
* Curvature adjustments
* Warping on original images
* Live video processing
* Deep learning pipeline for all of the above

Algorithms including Canny Edge Detection, Hough space
